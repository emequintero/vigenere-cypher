Born in Tanzania, Magawa started his explosive-sniffing career in Cambodia in 2016 and retired in 2021. He was one of a group of rodents called HeroRats. Magawa was the most successful working rat in the program, earning a prestigious PDSA Gold Medal in 2020. He was the first rat to receive the honor, which recognizes animals for bravery and devotion to duty.

Magawa's legacy lives on as Apopo's rat program continues. "Clearing minefields is intense, difficult, dangerous work and demands accuracy and time. This is where Apopo's animal detection systems can increase efficiency and cut costs," the group said. The intelligent animals, while large for rats, are light enough that they don't accidentally trigger the mines.
